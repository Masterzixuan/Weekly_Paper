# Deep learning for flash drought forecasting and interpretation

[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.02576)

Flash Drought预测局限性

> timely and accurate flash drought forecasting remains challenging for operational forecast systems due to uncertain representations of interactive hydroclimate processes.

Flash Drought 预测意义

> Flash droughts pose a new challenge for drought risk management, as societal preparedness and mitigation strategies heavily rely on S2S forecasts to guide water resource planning, agricultural decisions, and early warning systems

如何引入AI

> Artificial Intelligence (AI) models hold the potential to improve drought forecasts, benefiting from flexible representations of feature interactions and memory effects

使用的数据是NLDAS的rzSm，



flash drought定义：

> We then detect flash droughts as episodes when SM falls below its 40th percentile and then recovers above its 20th percentile

模型评估方法，仅使用了ACC计算误差（估计是因为RMSE比较差，为了只体现动态所以只体现了去掉bias的ACC，这个可以用到我的模型forecast上，用ACC体现相对变化）相当于是去掉了偏差，类似于rbRMSE，效果表现应该会更好：

> The accuracies of SM and flash drought forecasts are measured using the **anomaly correlation coefficient (ACC) **and **F1 score**, respectively.

我也可以计算一个百分比，应该不会很低，RMSE画图的配色可以学习（fig2）

> IT-Drought shows skillful SM forecasts in 99.56% of CONUS, where the average ACC over lead times up to two weeks exceeds 0.5

与传统的物理模型对比了ACC，模型包括：GEFS， CMA， ECMWF， HMRC

数据集划分,test集最好和train错开一些，对于美国可以选择2018作为test，2017作为val，其余作为训练

> IT-Drought was trained on 32 years (1979-1994 and 2001-2016), validated on 4 years (1995- 1996 and 2017-2018), and tested on 8 years (1997-2000 and 2019-2022) of data, respectively. We left a 2-year gap between the training and testing periods to remove the possible impacts of SM memory in the training periods on the testing periods



# A surrogate modeling method for distributed land surface hydrologicalmodels based on deep learning

[JOH](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169423008867)

替代模型的意义(文章的conclusion部分)

> It is worth noting that the ability of the DL networks to approximate the dynamic behaviour of complex distributed models is very useful for **parameter UQ problems** such as sensitivity analysis and model calibration. More research efforts are needed to develop DL-based UQ methods for reducing uncertainties, handling equifinality and improving predictive skill of distributed land surface hydrological models in a changing environment.

参数化困难

> These models usually involve a large number of spatially-varying parameters which can significantly affect the simulation and prediction accuracy

模型调参

> improving the accuracy and reliability of the models usually relies on parameter uncertainty quantification (UQ), which can help to identify which parameters have the most impact on model predictions

研究方法

输入输出数据：

> The common input of the two DL based surrogate models consists of 7 meteorological forcing variables of VIC **(precipitation, air temperature, atmospheric pressure, incoming [shortwave radiation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/short-wave-radiation), incoming [longwave radiation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/long-wave-radiation), [vapor pressure](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/vapor-pressure), wind speed)** plus 7 model parameters including variable infiltration curve parameter (b), maximum velocity of baseflow (Dsmax), fraction of Dsmax where non-linear baseflow begins (Ds), fraction of maximum soil moisture where non-linear baseflow occurs (Ws), the second soil layer thickness (d2), the third soil layer thickness (d3), the second soil layer drainage parameter (E2). For the ARnet model, the soil moisture of last day is also used as input.

基础模型：VIC模型，文章只选取了一个小区域作为研究对象，分辨率0.25度，图像大小只有24*17

评估方法：

> The evaluation methods used in our study not only include classical verification metrics like the coefficient of determination (), [correlation coefficients](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/correlation-coefficient) (CC), Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE; [Gupta et al., 2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169423008867#b0085)), but also consists of two bias-insensitive spatial performance metrics, namely empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis and the fractions skill score (FSS). Here, we provide a concise overview of two spatial performance metrics.

感觉后变可以基于我现在的模型做一个全球的VIC的替代模型，



# A multi-task learning model for global soil moisture prediction based on adaptive weight allocation

[scientific reports](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-01894-3)

传统物理模型预测的局限性：水文过程高度复杂，受气象、下垫面、人类活动等多因素耦合影响，模型结构与参数化难以全面刻画真实系统

> hydrological processes are influenced and interact with a number of factors, including meteorology, the underlying surface of watersheds and human activities. This makes it challenging for process-based models to accurately understand and predict complex hydrological phenomena.

新的数据集：LandBench，类似于Weatherbench，基于ERA5-Land

> LandBench 1.0 is a benchmark dataset designed specifically for data-driven prediction of surface variables (LSV), including key variables such as soil moisture, soil temperature, and surface heat flux.
